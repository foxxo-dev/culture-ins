          We investigated the different cultures and nationalities of our
          classmates and later interviewed them. The topics that we interviewed
          them about were Personal Appearance, Diet, and Greetings. After
          getting our answers we used them to answer our primary question. Which
          is about the striking similarities and differences of our classmates
          and their cultures.

        In my opinion, there are a lot of similarities between different
        cultures, but there are also differences that would be hard to find
        similarities in as they are completely dependent on culture. In my
        opinion, the way people greet their friends is quite similar. Our
        evidence to back this up is that they all say Hi/Hello to each other and
        give each other high fives which is quite expected. Another similarity
        is how they dress to each other on a casual day. They all wear jeans and
        a T-shirt which is still basic but similar.

            <h3>Personal Appearance</h3>
            <p>
              We’ve noticed that people who come from South Korea, <strong>Poland</strong>, and
              Belarus dress quite similarly. All of them casually wear a pair of
              jeans and a T-shirt. They don’t have a huge preference but prefer
              to wear Nike or other bigger brands. They like to dress nicely for
              formal occasions.

            <h3>Diet</h3>
            <p>
              At home, both Poles and South Koreans eat different types of soup.
              While South Koreans like to eat more traditional foods which our
              research did state.

            <h3>Greetings</h3>
            <p>
              All 3 nationalities we interviewed greet each other quite
              similarly to their friends. They all say Hi or Hello and then talk
              with each other. They give high-fives to each other when they
              meet. Culture grams stated similarly to this.

            <h3>Personal Appearance</h3>
            <p>
              On formal occasions, they’re quite different though. Polish people
              prefer to wear suits to formal occasions while Belarussians like
              to wear something new and more formal but not a suit. In both
              Poland and Belarus, they don’t need to wear school uniforms
              however in South Korea they have to wear a uniform, even on warm
              days.

            <h3>Diet</h3>
            <p>
              The person I interviewed for Belarus was quite different from my
              research as for breakfast they eat different things. The person
              for Belarus prefers fruits and vegetables for lunch which is only
              a bit similar to our research.

            <h3>Greetings</h3>
            <p>
              However, when greeting adults they are quite different. Polish
              people normally kiss each other on the cheek if they're the
              opposite gender and then shake hands. Belarussian people would say
              Good Morning or something else depending on the time of day, and
              then shake hands. The South Korean person I interviewed says that
              if they’re greeting an adult they will bow, and if it’s a family
              member they would bow and shake hands.
