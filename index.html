          We investigated the different cultures and nationalities of our
          classmates and later interviewed them. The topics that we interviewed
          them about were Personal Appearance, Diet, and Greetings. After
          getting our answers we used them to answer our primary question. Which
          is about the striking similarities and differences of our classmates
          and their cultures.

        In my opinion, there are a lot of <strong>similarities</strong> between
        different <strong>cultures</strong>, but there are also
        <strong>differences</strong> that would be hard to find
        <strong>similarities</strong> in as they are completely dependent on
        <strong>culture</strong>. In my opinion, the way people
        <strong>greet</strong> their friends is quite similar. Our evidence to
        back this up is that they all say <strong>Hi/Hello</strong> to each
        other and give each other <strong>high fives</strong> which is quite
        expected. Another <strong>similarity</strong> is how they
        <strong>dress</strong> to each other on a <strong>casual day</strong>.
        They all wear <strong>jeans</strong> and a
        <strong>T-shirt</strong> which is still basic but similar.

            <h3><strong>Personal Appearance</strong></h3>
            <p>
              We’ve noticed that people who come from
              <strong>South Korea</strong>, <strong>Poland</strong>, and
              <strong>Belarus</strong> dress quite similarly. All of them
              casually wear a pair of <strong>jeans</strong> and a
              <strong>T-shirt</strong>. They don’t have a huge preference but
              prefer to wear <strong>Nike</strong> or other bigger brands. They
              like to dress nicely for <strong>formal occasions</strong>.

            <h3><strong>Diet</strong></h3>
            <p>
              At home, both <strong>Poles</strong> and
              <strong>South Koreans</strong> eat different types of
              <strong>soup</strong>. While <strong>South Koreans</strong> like
              to eat more traditional foods which our research did state.

            <h3><strong>Greetings</strong></h3>
            <p>
              All 3 <strong>nationalities</strong> we interviewed greet each
              other quite similarly to their friends. They all say
              <strong>Hi</strong> or <strong>Hello</strong> and then talk with
              each other. They give <strong>high-fives</strong> to each other
              when they meet. <strong>Culture grams</strong> stated similarly to
              this.

            <h3><strong>Personal Appearance</strong></h3>
            <p>
              On <strong>formal occasions</strong>, they’re quite different
              though. <strong>Polish people</strong> prefer to wear
              <strong>suits</strong> to <strong>formal occasions</strong> while
              <strong>Belarussians</strong> like to wear something new and more
              formal but not a suit. In both <strong>Poland</strong> and
              <strong>Belarus</strong>, they don’t need to wear
              <strong>school uniforms</strong> however in
              <strong>South Korea</strong> they have to wear a
              <strong>uniform</strong>, even on warm days.

            <h3><strong>Diet</strong></h3>
            <p>
              The person I interviewed for <strong>Belarus</strong> was quite
              different from my research as for <strong>breakfast</strong> they
              eat different things. The person for
              <strong>Belarus</strong> prefers <strong>fruits</strong> and
              <strong>vegetables</strong> for <strong>lunch</strong> which is
              only a bit similar to our research.

            <h3><strong>Greetings</strong></h3>
            <p>
              However, when greeting <strong>adults</strong> they are quite
              different. <strong>Polish people</strong> normally
              <strong>kiss</strong> each other on the cheek if they're the
              opposite gender and then shake hands.
              <strong>Belarussian people</strong> would say
              <strong>Good Morning</strong> or something else depending on the
              time of day, and then shake hands. The
              <strong>South Korean</strong> person I interviewed says that if
              they’re greeting an adult they will <strong>bow</strong>, and if
              it’s a family member they would <strong>bow</strong> and shake
              hands.

          <h3>USA</h3>
          <p>
            The classmate we interviewed from the USA wears nicer clothes on
            formal occasions. This would be some nice shoes, a nice shirt and
            jeans. Casually, our classmate likes to wear some casual shoes,
            sweat pants and a T-shirt. At home, the person we interviewed most
            likes to eat Burgers, Tacos, Steak and some other foods. For
            breakfast they eat cereal and on weekends they’ll have pancakes.
            When greeting adults they shake hands and say Hello and when
            greeting friends it’s just a high five and what’s up.

          <h3>Belarus</h3>
          <p>
            The Belarussian classmate we interviewed says that for formal
            occasions they dress up nicely and it’s important to be wearing new
            clothes. Our research has stated that it’s important for them to
            dress well. However, casually my Belarussian classmate wears
            whatever is comfortable for them which our research didn’t exactly
            state. For breakfast, our research said that Belarussians like to
            eat warm cereal, however, my classmate said that they like to eat
            fruits and vegetables. For lunch, my classmate also likes to eat
            fruits and vegetables which was far from our research. When greeting
            friends our classmate just says what’s up and sometimes they give
            high fives to each other. When greeting formally our classmate
            shakes hands and says ‘Hello how are you’ which is similar to our
            research.

            alt="Statue 1" />
          <h3>South Korea</h3>
          <p>
            Our South Korean classmate wears jeans and a shirt daily which is
            similar to our research. When it’s warmer outside he’ll wear shorts
            and a T-shirt which is a bit similar to our research, as our
            research has stated that South Koreans tend to only wear shorts when
            it’s really warm outside or they’re going to the beach. At home, our
            classmate likes to eat traditional food and doesn’t eat food from
            other countries too often, which is almost the same as what our
            research has stated. However, this also happens because our
            classmate has only lived in Poland for a year. When greeting adults
            our classmates shake hands and give a bow which is similar to our
            research. To friends, he just says Hi or Hello and gives high fives.

          <h3>Poland</h3>
          <p>
            Polish people like to dress nicer. On a casual day, they will just
            put on jeans and a nice T-shirt. On formal occasions women like to
            dress up and men wear suits. The classmate from Poland I interviewed
            likes to eat waffles and sometimes scrambled eggs for breakfast. Our
            research wasn’t too similar to this. For lunch/dinner Poles enjoy
            eating different types of soup and meats. Lastly, Polish people
            greet their friends with a Hello and sometimes a high five. Adults
            greet with a handshake, and if they are the opposite gender they
            hug.
